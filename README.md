# coq-alpha-pearl

## Summary

A Coq formalization of "Functional Pearls: Î±-conversion is easy" (Altenkirch, 2002). The most important file is [theories/Alpha.v].

To our knowledge, everything in the paper itself has been formalized. (Proving the equivalence to de Bruijn terms is still in progress, but because it is left to the reader in the original paper, we are comfortable sharing this formalization as-is.)

## Dependencies

This formalization relies on the following libraries:

  - [math-comp](https://github.com/math-comp/math-comp/)
  - [extructures](https://github.com/arthuraa/extructures/)
